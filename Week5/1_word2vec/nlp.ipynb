    "In <<chapter_intro>> we saw that deep learning can be used to get great results with natural language datasets. Our example relied on using a pretrained language model and fine-tuning it to classify reviews. That example highlighted a difference between transfer learning in NLP and computer vision: in general in NLP the pretrained model is trained on a different task.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we call a language model is a model that has been trained to guess what the next word in a text is (having read the ones before). This kind of task is called *self-supervised learning*: we do not need to give labels to our model, just feed it lots and lots of texts. It has a process to automatically get labels from the data, and this task isn't trivial: to properly guess the next word in a sentence, the model will have to develop an understanding of the English (or other) language. Self-supervised learning can also be used in other domains; for instance, see [\"Self-Supervised Learning and Computer Vision\"](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/) for an introduction to vision applications. Self-supervised learning is not usually used for the model that is trained directly, but instead is used for pretraining a model used for transfer learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "我们所说的语言模型是一种经过训练可以猜测文本中的下一个单词是什么（之前读过的单词）的模型。这种任务称为`自我监督学习`：我们不需要给模型添加标签，只需向其提供大量文本即可。它有一个自动从数据中获取标签的过程，而这项任务并不简单：为了正确猜测句子中的下一个单词，模型必须培养对英语（或其他）语言的理解。自监督学习也可以用于其他领域；例如，有关视觉应用的介绍，请参阅[`自监督学习和计算机视觉`](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/)。自监督学习通常不用于直接训练的模型，而是用于预训练用于迁移学习的模型。"

    "The language model we used in <<chapter_intro>> to classify IMDb reviews was pretrained on Wikipedia. We got great results by directly fine-tuning this language model to a movie review classifier, but with one extra step, we can do even better. The Wikipedia English is slightly different from the IMDb English, so instead of jumping directly to the classifier, we could fine-tune our pretrained language model to the IMDb corpus and then use *that* as the base for our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if our language model knows the basics of the language we are using in the task (e.g., our pretrained model is in English), it helps to get used to the style of the corpus we are targeting. It may be more informal language, or more technical, with new words to learn or different ways of composing sentences. In the case of the IMDb dataset, there will be lots of names of movie directors and actors, and often a less formal style of language than that seen in Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already saw that with fastai, we can download a pretrained English language model and use it to get state-of-the-art results for NLP classification. (We expect pretrained models in many more languages to be available soon—they might well be available by the time you are reading this book, in fact.) So, why are we learning how to train a language model in detail?\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason, of course, is that it is helpful to understand the foundations of the models that you are using. But there is another very practical reason, which is that you get even better results if you fine-tune the (sequence-based) language model prior to fine-tuning the classification model. For instance, for the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached. Since there are 25,000 labeled reviews in the training set and 25,000 in the validation set, that makes 100,000 movie reviews altogether. We can use all of these reviews to fine-tune the pretrained language model, which was trained only on Wikipedia articles; this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFit) approach. The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) showed that this extra stage of fine-tuning of the language model, prior to transfer learning to a classification task, resulted in significantly better predictions. Using this approach, we have three stages for transfer learning in NLP, as summarized in <<ulmfit_process>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "我们在 <<chapter_intro>> 中用于对 IMDb 评论进行分类的语言模型是在维基百科上进行预训练的。通过直接将此语言模型微调为电影评论分类器，我们获得了很好的结果，但通过一个额外的步骤，我们可以做得更好。维基百科英语与 IMDb 英语略有不同，因此我们可以将预训练的语言模型微调到 IMDb 语料库，然后使用 *that* 作为我们分类器的基础，而不是直接跳转到分类器。\n",
    "\n",
    "即使我们的语言模型知道我们在任务中使用的语言的基础知识（例如，我们的预训练模型是英语），它也有助于适应我们目标语料库的风格。它可能是更非正式的语言，或更技术性的语言，需要学习新单词或不同的造句方式。就 IMDb 数据集而言，会有大量电影导演和演员的名字，并且通常采用比维基百科中不太正式的语言风格。\n",
    "\n",
    "我们已经看到，通过 fastai，我们可以下载预训练的英语语言模型，并使用它来获得 NLP 分类的最新结果。 （我们预计更多语言的预训练模型很快就会推出——事实上，当你阅读本书时，它们很可能已经可用。）那么，我们为什么要学习如何详细训练语言模型呢？\n",
    "\n",
    "当然，原因之一是了解您正在使用的模型的基础很有帮助。但还有另一个非常实际的原因，那就是如果在微调分类模型之前微调（基于序列的）语言模型，您会得到更好的结果。例如，对于 IMDb 情感分析任务，数据集包含 50,000 条额外的电影评论，这些评论没有附加任何正面或负面标签。由于训练集中有 25,000 条带标签的评论，验证集中有 25,000 条带标签的评论，因此总共有 100,000 条电影评论。我们可以使用所有这些评论来微调预训练的语言模型，该模型仅在维基百科文章上进行训练；这将产生一个特别擅长预测电影评论的下一个单词的语言模型。\n",
    "\n",
    "这称为通用语言模型微调 (ULMFit) 方法。 [论文](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) 表明，在将学习转移到分类任务之前，对语言模型进行额外的微调可以产生更好的预测。使用这种方法，我们在 NLP 中进行迁移学习的三个阶段，如《ulmfit_process》中所总结的那样。"

(A dedicated embedding matrix can take as inputs the raw vocab indexes created in step 2; this is equivalent to but faster and more efficient than a matrix that takes as input one-hot-encoded vectors representing the indexes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do nearly the same thing with text! What is new is the idea of a sequence. First we concatenate all of the documents in our dataset into one big long string and split it into words, giving us a very long list of words (or \"tokens\"). Our independent variable will be the sequence of words starting with the first word in our very long list and ending with the second to last, and our dependent variable will be the sequence of words starting with the second word and ending with the last word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our vocab will consist of a mix of common words that are already in the vocabulary of our pretrained model and new words specific to our corpus (cinematographic terms or actors names, for instance). Our embedding matrix will be built accordingly: for words that are in the vocabulary of our pretrained model, we will take the corresponding row in the embedding matrix of the pretrained model; but for new words we won't have anything, so we will just initialize the corresponding row with a random vector.\n",

    "1. 将每个级别替换为其在词汇表中的索引。\n",

    "1. 使用该嵌入矩阵作为神经网络的第一层。 （专用嵌入矩阵可以将步骤 2 中创建的原始词汇索引作为输入；这与将表示索引的 one-hot 编码向量作为输入的矩阵等效，但更快、更高效。）\n",
    "\n",
    "我们可以用文本做几乎同样的事情！新的是序列的想法。首先，我们将数据集中的所有文档连接成一个大的长字符串，并将其拆分为单词，从而为我们提供一个非常长的单词列表（或`标记`）。我们的自变量将是从很长的列表中的第一个单词开始到倒数第二个单词结束的单词序列，我们的因变量将是从第二个单词开始到最后一个单词结束的单词序列。 \n",
    "\n",
    "我们的词汇将由预训练模型词汇表中已有的常用单词和语料库特有的新单词（例如电影术语或演员姓名）组成。我们的嵌入矩阵将相应地构建：对于预训练模型词汇表中的单词，我们将采用预训练模型嵌入矩阵中的相应行；但对于新单词，我们不会有任何东西，因此我们将用随机向量初始化相应的行。"

    "Notice that there are now some tokens that start with the characters \"xx\", which is not a common word prefix in English. These are *special tokens*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the first item in the list, `xxbos`, is a special token that indicates the start of a new text (\"BOS\" is a standard NLP acronym that means \"beginning of stream\"). By recognizing this start token, the model will be able to learn it needs to \"forget\" what was said previously and focus on upcoming words.\n",
    "\n",
    "These special tokens don't come from spaCy directly. They are there because fastai adds them by default, by applying a number of rules when processing text. These rules are designed to make it easier for a model to recognize the important parts of a sentence. In a sense, we are translating the original English language sequence into a simplified tokenized language—a language that is designed to be easy for a model to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the rules will replace a sequence of four exclamation points with a special *repeated character* token, followed by the number four, and then a single exclamation point. In this way, the model's embedding matrix can encode information about general concepts such as repeated punctuation rather than requiring a separate token for every number of repetitions of every punctuation mark. Similarly, a capitalized word will be replaced with a special capitalization token, followed by the lowercase version of the word. This way, the embedding matrix only needs the lowercase versions of the words, saving compute and memory resources, but can still learn the concept of capitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the main special tokens you'll see:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `xxbos`:: Indicates the beginning of a text (here, a review)\n",
    "- `xxmaj`:: Indicates the next word begins with a capital (since we lowercased everything)\n",
    "- `xxunk`:: Indicates the word is unknown\n",

    "请注意，现在有一些标记以字符`xx`开头，这在英语中不是常见的单词前缀。这些是*特殊令牌*。\n",
    "\n",
    "例如，列表中的第一项`xxbos`是一个特殊标记，指示新文本的开始（`BOS`是标准 NLP 缩写，意思是`流的开始`）。通过识别这个开始标记，该模型将能够学习它需要`忘记`之前所说的内容并专注于接下来的单词。\n",
    "\n",
    "这些特殊令牌并不直接来自 spaCy。它们之所以存在，是因为 fastai 在处理文本时应用了许多规则，默认添加它们。这些规则旨在使模型更容易识别句子的重要部分。从某种意义上说，我们正在将原始英语语言序列翻译成简化的标记语言——一种旨在使模型易于学习的语言。\n",
    "\n",
    "例如，规则将用特殊的*repeat charactor*标记替换四个感叹号的序列，后跟数字4，然后是单个感叹号'!'。通过这种方式，模型的嵌入矩阵可以对有关一般概念（例如重复标点符号）的信息进行编码，而不需要为每个标点符号的每次重复次数使用单独的标记。同样，大写单词将被替换为特殊的大写标记，后跟该单词的小写版本。这样，嵌入矩阵只需要单词的小写版本，节省了计算和内存资源，但仍然可以学习大写的概念。\n",
    "\n",
    "以下是您将看到的一些主要特殊标记：\n",
    "\n",
    "- `xxbos`:: 表示文本的开头（这里是预览）\n",
    "- `xxmaj`:: 表示下一个单词以大写开头（因为我们将所有内容都小写）\n",

    "In addition to the *word tokenization* approach seen in the last section, another popular tokenization method is *subword tokenization*. Word tokenization relies on an assumption that spaces provide a useful separation of components of meaning in a sentence. However, this assumption is not always appropriate. For instance, consider this sentence: 我的名字是郝杰瑞 (\"My name is Jeremy Howard\" in Chinese). That's not going to work very well with a word tokenizer, because there are no spaces in it! Languages like Chinese and Japanese don't use spaces, and in fact they don't even have a well-defined concept of a \"word.\" There are also languages, like Turkish and Hungarian, that can add many subwords together without spaces, creating very long words that include a lot of separate pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle these cases, it's generally best to use subword tokenization. This proceeds in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze a corpus of documents to find the most commonly occurring groups of letters. These become the vocab.\n",
    "2. Tokenize the corpus using this vocab of *subword units*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example. For our corpus, we'll use the first 2,000 movie reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "除了上一节中看到的`单词标记化`方法之外，另一种流行的标记化方法是`子词标记化`。单词标记化依赖于这样一个假设：空格提供了句子中含义成分的有用分离。然而，这种假设并不总是合适的。例如，考虑这句话：我的名字是郝杰瑞（中文`我的名字是杰里米·霍华德`）。这对于单词标记器来说效果不太好，因为其中没有空格！像中文和日语这样的语言不使用空格，事实上它们甚至没有明确定义的`单词`概念。还有一些语言，例如土耳其语和匈牙利语，可以将许多子词添加在一起而不使用空格，从而创建包含许多单独信息的非常长的单词。\n",
    "\n",
    "为了处理这些情况，通常最好使用子词标记化。这分两步进行：\n",

    "1. 分析文档语料库以查找最常出现的字母组。这些成为词汇。\n",

This is useful to avoid having an overly large embedding matrix, since that can slow down training and use up too much memory, and can also mean that there isn't enough data to train useful representations for rare words.

As with images, it's best to randomize the order of the inputs, so at the beginning of each epoch we will shuffle the entries to make a new stream (we shuffle the order of the documents, not the order of the words inside them, or the texts would not make sense anymore!).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then cut this stream into a certain number of batches (which is our *batch size*). For instance, if the stream has 50,000 tokens and we set a batch size of 10, this will give us 10 mini-streams of 5,000 tokens. What is important is that we preserve the order of the tokens (so from 1 to 5,000 for the first mini-stream, then from 5,001 to 10,000...), because we want the model to read continuous rows of text (as in the preceding example). An `xxbos` token is added at the start of each during preprocessing, so that the model knows when it reads the stream when a new entry is beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to recap, at every epoch we shuffle our collection of documents and concatenate them into a stream of tokens. We then cut that stream into a batch of fixed-size consecutive mini-streams. Our model will then read the mini-streams in order, and thanks to an inner state, it will produce the same activation whatever sequence length we picked.\n",

    "Remember, PyTorch `DataLoader`s need to collate all the items in a batch into a single tensor, and a single tensor has a fixed shape (i.e., it has some particular length on every axis, and all items must be consistent). This should sound familiar: we had the same issue with images. In that case, we used cropping, padding, and/or squishing to make all the inputs the same size. Cropping might not be a good idea for documents, because it seems likely we'd remove some key information (having said that, the same issue is true for images, and we use cropping there; data augmentation hasn't been well explored for NLP yet, so perhaps there are actually opportunities to use cropping in NLP too!). You can't really \"squish\" a document. So that leaves padding!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will expand the shortest texts to make them all the same size. To do this, we use a special padding token that will be ignored by our model. Additionally, to avoid memory issues and improve performance, we will batch together texts that are roughly the same lengths (with some shuffling for the training set). We do this by (approximately, for the training set) sorting the documents by length prior to each epoch. The result of this is that the documents collated into a single batch will tend to be of similar lengths. We won't pad every batch to the same size, but will instead use the size of the largest document in each batch as the target size. (It is possible to do something similar with images, which is especially useful for irregularly sized rectangular images, but at the time of writing no library provides good support for this yet, and there aren't any papers covering it. It's something we're planning to add to fastai soon, however, so keep an eye on the book's website; we'll add information about this as soon as we have it working well.)\n",

    "Even simple algorithms based on rules, before the days of widely available deep learning language models, could be used to create fraudulent accounts and try to influence policymakers. Jeff Kao, now a computational journalist at ProPublica, analyzed the comments that were sent to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding a 2017 proposal to repeal net neutrality. In his article [\"More than a Million Pro-Repeal Net Neutrality Comments Were Likely Faked\"](https://hackernoon.com/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6), he reports how he discovered a large cluster of comments opposing net neutrality that seemed to have been generated by some sort of Mad Libs-style mail merge. In <<disinformation>>, the fake comments have been helpfully color-coded by Kao to highlight their formulaic nature."

You now have all the necessary tools at your disposal to create a compelling language model—that is, something that can generate context-appropriate, believable text. It won't necessarily be perfectly accurate or correct, but it will be plausible. Think about what this technology would mean when put together with the kinds of disinformation campaigns we have learned about in recent years. Take a look at the Reddit dialogue shown in <<ethics_reddit>>, where a language model based on OpenAI's GPT-2 algorithm is having a conversation with itself about whether the US government should cut defense spending."
